In this project I was given data from an academic literature review, it was already clean and standardized. Data was in an excel file with a document-term matrix (each term has a 1 if it occurs in each document and a 0 if not). Each document also has additional categorical variables that describe it. It was around 100 docs by 100 terms. I were to perform these analysis on the data:

1. A co-occurrence network of the terms (based on co-occurrence in documents) and being able to see (ex via node size and color) some patterns in the descriptive information.
2. Multiple correspondence analysis.
3. Some way to visualize progression over time (ex. through a historical direct citation network but instead of citations occurrences of the terms).
